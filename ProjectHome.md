The Timeline project is an extension of the ExtJS interface library. It's goals are simple:

  1. Provide a framework for undo/redo of user events.
  1. Be generic enough for widespread basic use.
  1. Be extensible enough for easy customization.
  1. Be free to everyone, for any purpose, personal or commercial.
